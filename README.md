# Greetings Explorerüéâ
üéâYou have reached invidious.party project, where [invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious "invidious") instances have a party üéâ<br>
invidious.party is a fully static site build using ![svelte hoolingans reprezent](https://cdn.discordapp.com/icons/457912077277855764/ea3d74c9d4e51d12cd2daa3ea1b44bb6.png?size=32 "svelte hoolingans reprezent") [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) 

## installation
```
git clone https://github.com/wyzwanie/invidious-party.git project-folder
cd project-folder
npm i

npm run dev     // dev environment
npm run build   // compile svelteKit to static html+css+js in build folder
npm run preview // preview build
```


## inspiration
showing invidious to non-technical friend, had to try multiple domains before one worked.<br>
using invidious daily as full replacement for yt, had to copy instance addresses to find one that had particular channel or video.

## solo mode
in solo mode your browser communicates only with invidious instances to serve you content.<br>
by default your subscriptions and settings are stored only in browser' localStorage<br>
if you want to share your data with a friend or another device you can do so using bookmarks and QRcodes (WIP)<br>
this solution apart from obvious drawback that everytime you add a subscription you need to bookmark new address [maybe some snippet?]<br>
has a limitations on maximum number of subscriptions (150) or videos in playlist (500) per link

## party mode
in order to have a party there needs to be a way for browsers to communicate directly between each other.<br>
made possible thanks to brilliant package [trystero](https://github.com/dmotz/trystero)

in party mode we use torrent trackers for signaling, so browsers can find direct communication tunnel.<br>
in party mode you notify party members what you are watching by broadcasting videoID you watch,(WIP)<br>
so other peers having a party, can dynamically see what is being watched right now, have fun in (to be encrypted)<br>
global public p2p chat

## browser support
only modern, no mobile version yet

## routes status
- index (will be some party room with p2p interaction sharing videos currently being watched)
- popular (done)
- trending (done)
- watch (partially done)
- search (partially done)
- channel (partially done)
- playlist (partially done)
- subscriptions (prototype working with localStorage)
